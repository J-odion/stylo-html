          There are six types of corn: sweet corn, popcorn, flour corn, dent
          corn, flint corn and pod corn. Whilst each of these types has
          different characteristics and uses, all are grown in a similar way.

          It starts with the planting of seeds in an inch or two of soil in
          short rows. It then takes around 5 – 12 days for the seeds to
          germinate, depending on the type of corn and the temperature of the
          soil. They then continue to grow and develop leaves and thick stalks,
          in some cases reaching heights of up to 15 feet. It’s corn’s
          versatility that has made it such a highly investable asset. But what
          does the market currently look like and where is it heading? TFG has
          gathered some important information about the corn market to help
          answer these questions. Corn accounted for nearly half of all global
          grain production in 2017. This glut in supply limited prices in 2017
          and continued to do so into 2018. However, the outlook isn’t all doom
          and gloom. Corn production is expected to be lower in 2018 and this
          will reduce the supply. It’s also speculated that there will be an
          increased demand for corn as a result of low prices and an increasing
          demand for biofuels. In 2017, China began to roll out its plans to
          drastically increase its use of ethanol in gasoline in an attempt to
          move towards cleaner energy sources by 2020. With around 1.4 billion
          hungry mouths to feed, it’s also possible that there will be an
          increased demand for livestock feed in China as the country becomes
          more wealthy and increases its meat consumption. For investors that
          are willing to bet on Chinese demand, this provides a good incentive
          to invest in corn.
